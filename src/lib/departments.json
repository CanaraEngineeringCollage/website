    "description": "The department was started in the year 2001 to offer under graduate degree programme i.e. Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Computer Science & Engineering (CS&E). The department also offered post graduate programme in engineering i.e. MTech in Computer Science Engineering (CS&E) from 2011 to 2021. The department has dedicated, qualified and experienced faculty members to guide the students in academics. The faculty members are actively involved in teaching, product development and research. The faculty members have published number of research and review papers/articles in referred International journals and reputed International conferences which are archived at IEEE/ACM/Springer and other renowned digital libraries. The department frequently organizes training programmes for the faculty, technical staff and students. The faculty frequently attends staff development programmes (SDP/FDP/Seminar) to update themselves in technological advancements and conferences to present research findings.The department aims at building the students’ career by placing special emphasis on all-round development through continuous interaction with Industry. Interactive sessions with experts from academia, research laboratories and industry are constantly held so as to enable students to gain knowledge on diverse and emerging fields. The campus placement has been scaling higher and higher peaks right from its inception with multinational companies recruiting students in large numbers. To increase the opportunity of placements to students, the department conducts soft skills training programmes, technical skill development activities and initiatives on self-learning (Spoken Tutorial programmes by IIT Bombay). The department promotes extracurricular activities under the umbrella of the students’ association & SPECS. The department brings out Annual technical magazine and newsletter which provides an opportunity for the students and staff to publish innovative ideas, programming tips and articles on current trends in computing and technology. The students’association and National Service Scheme (NSS) wing frequently conducts various programmes to strengthen leadership skills, teamwork and communication; and awareness on protection of environment and social responsibilities.",

I hope you will browse our OBE (Outcome Based Education) driven teaching-learning process, student achievements and activities. Our primary goal is to provide quality technical education in Computer Science and Engineering enriched with values. The process of learning is extremely important in life and it plays a crucial role in developing one's intellectual capability, besides career. We follow outcome based teaching-learning process that bridges the theory - practice gap while remaining grounded in the core of computer science and engineering. Nowadays the technology is changing rapidly, especially in the field of computing. To face this challenge, we equip our students for problem-solving and expose them to the state-of-the-art in computer science and information technology. We also work hard to help students to improve their verbal and written communication abilities, analytical thinking, and soft skills so that they may flourish in the corporate world. We believe that, our students who are clear and thorough in computer fundamentals coupled with practical experience can adapt to rapid changes in technology or software industry easily. The department has produced hundreds of competent professionals and has established a name for itself in the region. Thanks to the efforts of our Management, affiliating University (VTU), faculty, alumni, parents and the students.",

    "description": "The department was started in the year 2021 to offer under graduate degree programme i.e. Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Computer Science & Design (CS&D). The department has dedicated, qualified and experienced faculty members to guide the students in academics. The faculty members are actively involved in teaching, product development and research. The faculty members have published number of researchpapers/articles in referred International journals and reputed International conferences which are archived at IEEE, Springer-Nature and other renowned digital libraries. The faculty frequently attends staff development programmes (SDP/FDP/Seminar) to update themselves in technological advancements and conferences to present research findings.The department aims at building the students’ career by placing special emphasis on all-round development through continuous interaction with Industry. Interactive sessions with experts from academia, research laboratories and industry are constantly held so as to enable students to gain knowledge on diverse and emerging fields. The campus placement has been scaling higher and higher peaks right from its inception with multinational companies recruiting students in large numbers. To increase the opportunity of placements to students, the department conducts soft skills training programmes, technical skill development activities and initiatives on self-learning (Spoken Tutorial programmes by IIT Bombay, and Certification Courses by ICT Academy). The department brings out Bi-Annual newsletter which provides an opportunity for the students and staff to publish innovative ideas, programming tips and articles on current trends in computing and technology. The National Service Scheme (NSS) wing frequently conducts various programmes to strengthen leadership skills, teamwork, and communication; and awareness on protection of environment and social responsibilities.",

      "messageFromtheDepartmentHead": "Greetings from the department of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning(AI&ML).It gives me immense pleasure to introduce the department and its Web pages. With the rapid growth of the technology development in the world, the artificial intelligent systems are becoming a part of life. Therefore, the main goal of the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) department is to give high-quality technical education in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The development of intellectual skills that support the growth of career advancement depends on lifelong learning. To improve students' abilities and understanding in the field of computer science and its cutting-edge technologies, we adopt an outcome-based teaching and learning process (AI&ML). Nowadays, with the rapid growth of internet usage from large scale industries to small scale industries and from urban to rural areas due to availability of internet with high-speed broadband, the users have adopted internet as a part of life. With the use of the internet and advanced technologies, the society is consequently facing numerous challenges. The department focuses on these issues, helps students and staff members comprehend them, and inspires them to develop technology solutions to deal with these challenges. We encourage and support the students and staff members of department in research, innovations and entrepreneurship activities to provide technological solutions to the relevant challenges of society. And we are confident that our students, who have a solid understanding of computer basics and real-world experience, will be able to quickly adjust to changes in technology or the software business. In this regard, it gives me immense pleasure to invite you all to be part of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Department to take it to the greater hights.One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men. No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man. - Elbert Hubbard (Author). Therefore, become an extraordinary man and I wish you all the best and have great academic careers.",

        <p>
          The only teaching model doesnâ€™t match the current rapid developments in technical education. Imparting quality education in technical
          colleges needs to be ensured with up-to-date knowledge of technology and science. This can be ensured with the active participation of
          faculty and students in research & development activities. Thus, the college's R&D, innovation cell has been established to inculcate
          research activities among faculty, scholars, and students.The research activity comprising fundamental research, interdisciplinary and
          multidisciplinary research, and product developments till TRL 6 to 7 are encouraged under the cell. Further, faculty and students were
          motivated to carry out projects with government and private funded projects. Also, the college is striving to impart a culture of
          collaboration projects with Tier-1 institutes.

          Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) is a dynamic field which encompasses the acquisition, communication, manipulation, and
          analysis of Information/Signals. This discipline spans a wide range of applications from everyday electronics to complex systems used in
          industries, medical devices, and beyond. EC has experienced rapid technological growth, and its impact is evident across numerous domains of
          engineering. The comprehensive curriculum of ECE provides students with abundant career opportunities, not only in Electronics and
          Communication but also in allied fields such as Instrumentation, Computer Engineering, Aeronautics, Mechatronics, and Biomedical
          Engineering. Our faculty members are highly experienced and dedicated to guiding students toward successful careers, advanced studies, and
          research activities. They have contributed significantly to international journals and attended numerous professional development workshops.
